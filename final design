Check Transaction ID

Yes: Proceed with the resubmit process.
No: Continue with the existing transaction flow.
Resubmit Process (If "retry" Present)

Step 1: Insert Record into Transaction_Info Collection
Insert a new record with the resubmit transaction ID details and set the status to "RESUBMIT."
Step 2: Update Original Transaction Status
Update the original transaction ID status from "FAILURE" to "Resubmit for approval."
Step 3: Generate Ticket for Approver
Generate a ticket for the approver to either approve, reject, or cancel the resubmit request.

The process ends after updating the necessary records.
Key Considerations
Validation: Ensure that the transaction ID contains "retry" and the original transaction status is "FAILURE" before starting the resubmit process.
Database Operations: The flow involves creating or updating records in both the Resubmit Order Collection and Transaction_Info Collection depending on the outcome of the resubmit process.
Status Updates: The status of both the original transaction and the resubmit transaction is carefully managed based on the approver's decision.
This flow ensures clarity and handles each possible outcome efficiently, maintaining data consistency throughout the resubmit process.
