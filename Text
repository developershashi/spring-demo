I want to inform my manager that I have been working on the task involving Prometheus
metrics through JMX. I made several attempts, including running scripts to download the
Prometheus JAR and installing it. I also created Prometheus YAML and config.yml files, but it
didn't work. When I enabled JMX locally, I could see the metrics and health endpoints, but
they weren't accessible from Prometheus. In addition, I investigated the Spring Web
vulnerability issue and found that it is related to JK 11. The potential solutions include
downgrading the JD version to 1.8, which would make the current Spring version
compatible, or upgrading and testing the system. I asked the infrastructure team about the
estimated time required for testing on the development environment, and they mentioned it
would take a maximum of 1 hour. I would like to inquire if we can proceed with the upgrade.
