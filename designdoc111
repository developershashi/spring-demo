Design Document: Resubmit Process Enhancement
1. Objective
To enhance the existing transaction processing system with a resubmit feature that checks whether a transaction ID contains the "retry" string, updates the resubmit order collection, and modifies transaction statuses based on the resubmit outcome.

2. Scope
Check Transaction ID: Determine if the transaction ID contains the string "retry."
Resubmit Order Collection: Create or update a resubmit order collection.
Transaction Info Collection: Insert details of the resubmitted transaction ID with a status of "RESUBMIT."
Status Updates:
Update the original transaction ID status based on various conditions (e.g., from "FAILURE" to "Resubmit for approval").
Update the resubmit order collection status from "OPEN" to either "APPROVED," "REJECTED," or "CANCELLED."
Update the resubmit transaction ID status accordingly.
3. Process Flow
3.1. Initial Check
Input: Transaction ID.
Condition: Check if the transaction ID contains the string "retry."
True: Proceed with creating/updating the resubmit order collection.
False: No action required for resubmit process.
3.2. Create/Update Resubmit Order Collection
Collection: resubmit_order
Fields:
order_id: Unique identifier for the order.
order_status: Initial status set to "OPEN."
original_transaction_ids: List of original transaction IDs.
resubmit_transaction_ids: List of corresponding resubmitted transaction IDs with "retry" appended.
created_at: Timestamp of order creation.
updated_at: Timestamp of the last update.
order_origin: Origin of the order (e.g., "NNIP").
3.3. Insert into Transaction Info Collection
Collection: transaction_info
Operation: Insert a new record for the resubmitted transaction ID with the status set to "RESUBMIT."
3.4. Status Update Logic
3.4.1. If Approved
Original Transaction Status:
From "FAILURE" to "Resubmit for approval."
From "Resubmit_for_approval" to "APPROVED."
Resubmit Order Status:
Update from "OPEN" to "APPROVED."
Resubmit Transaction Status:
From "RESUBMIT" to "RETRY."
3.4.2. If Rejected
Original Transaction Status:
From "FAILURE" to "Resubmit for approval."
From "Resubmit_for_approval" to "REJECTED."
Resubmit Order Status:
Update from "OPEN" to "REJECTED."
Resubmit Transaction Status:
From "RESUBMIT" to "REJECTED."
3.4.3. If Cancelled
Original Transaction Status:
From "FAILURE" to "Resubmit for approval."
From "Resubmit_for_approval" to "CANCELLED."
Resubmit Order Status:
Update from "OPEN" to "CANCELLED."
Resubmit Transaction Status:
From "RESUBMIT" to "CANCELLED."
4. Data Model
4.1. Resubmit Order Collection
Field Name	Type	Description
order_id	String	Unique identifier for the resubmit order.
order_status	String	Status of the resubmit order (e.g., OPEN, APPROVED, REJECTED, CANCELLED).
original_transaction_ids	List<String>	List of original transaction IDs.
resubmit_transaction_ids	List<String>	List of resubmitted transaction IDs.
created_at	DateTime	Timestamp when the order was created.
updated_at	DateTime	Timestamp when the order was last updated.
order_origin	String	Source or origin of the order.
4.2. Transaction Info Collection
Field Name	Type	Description
transaction_id	String	Unique identifier for the transaction.
status	String	Status of the transaction (e.g., FAILURE, RESUBMIT, RETRY, APPROVED, REJECTED, CANCELLED).
original_transaction_id	String	The original transaction ID linked to this resubmit transaction.
created_at	DateTime	Timestamp when the transaction was created.
updated_at	DateTime	Timestamp when the transaction was last updated.
5. Assumptions
The transaction ID structure is known and follows a consistent pattern that allows checking for the "retry" string.
The system has the necessary permissions to read, write, and update both resubmit_order and transaction_info collections.
The transaction statuses are well-defined and do not overlap.
6. Constraints
The resubmit process should be idempotent to avoid duplicate entries.
Proper error handling should be in place if the resubmit process fails at any stage.
7. Security Considerations
Ensure that the update operations are performed in a secure manner with audit logging enabled for tracking changes.
Validate all inputs to prevent any injection attacks.
8. Testing Plan
Unit Tests: Verify individual components like checking transaction IDs, inserting into collections, and updating statuses.
Integration Tests: Test the entire flow from transaction ID checking to the final status update.
Performance Testing: Ensure the resubmit process can handle a large volume of transactions efficiently.
9. Implementation Timeline
Design Review: 1 week
Development: 2-3 weeks
Testing: 1-2 weeks
Deployment: 1 week
10. Conclusion
This enhancement to the transaction processing system adds a robust resubmit feature that handles various scenarios like approval, rejection, and cancellation efficiently. It ensures that transaction statuses are updated consistently across collections, maintaining data integrity and supporting business workflows.

Here's a description of how the flow diagram for the resubmit process would look:

Flow Diagram for Resubmit Process
Start:

Entry point for the resubmit process.
Check if Transaction ID Contains 'retry':

Decision Node:
Yes: Proceed to the next step.
No: End process (No action required).
Create/Update Resubmit Order Collection:

Action Node: Create or update the resubmit order collection with relevant details (order_id, status, transaction IDs, etc.).
Insert Resubmit Transaction into Transaction Info Collection:

Action Node: Insert a new entry for the resubmit transaction ID into the transaction_info collection with status "RESUBMIT".
Update Original Transaction Status:

Action Node: Update the original transaction ID status to "Resubmit for approval".
Resubmit Outcome Decision:

Decision Node: Evaluate the outcome of the resubmit process.
Approved:
Update original transaction ID status to "APPROVED".
Update resubmit order collection status to "APPROVED".
Update resubmit transaction ID status to "RETRY".
Rejected:
Update original transaction ID status to "REJECTED".
Update resubmit order collection status to "REJECTED".
Update resubmit transaction ID status to "REJECTED".
Cancelled:
Update original transaction ID status to "CANCELLED".
Update resubmit order collection status to "CANCELLED".
Update resubmit transaction ID status to "CANCELLED".
End:

Process concludes after updating all statuses.
